SoapTools is a Pytorch-based Blender extension for 3D modeling based on constraint systems, encouraging formal emergence through the exploration of constraints rather than the definition of fixed problems with optimal solutions.

# Getting Started

For a cursory guide on use of the extension, refer to [my personal blog](tpes.ch/blog/soaptools).

CPU-only releases are available [here](https://github.com/CyWP/SoapTools/releases/tag/0.0.1). You can follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OislZA-NgWo) for installation.

For those seeking CUDA acceleration or the dev version, you can follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP0s1i9EXeM) to install and edit the extension from source.
